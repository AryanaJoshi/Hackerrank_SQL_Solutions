Generate the following two result sets:

Query an alphabetically ordered list of all names in OCCUPATIONS, 
immediately followed by the first letter of each profession as a parenthetical (i.e.: enclosed in parentheses). 

Query the number of ocurrences of each occupation in OCCUPATIONS. 
Sort the occurrences in ascending order, and output them in the following format: 

There are a total of [occupation_count] [occupation]s.
where [occupation_count] is the number of occurrences of an occupation in OCCUPATIONS and 
[occupation] is the lowercase occupation name. 
If more than one Occupation has the same [occupation_count], they should be ordered alphabetically.


SELECT NAME|| "("SUBSTR(OCCUPATION,1)")" n FROM OCCUPATIONS ORDER BY n

SELECT "There are a total of"||COUNT(OCCUPATIONS)|| LOWER(OCCUPATION)||'s.' as total
From OCCUPATIONS GROUP BY OCCUPATION ORDER BY TOTAL;
